title: Franklin's Birthday Party
description: "The ghost of Benjamin Franklin - free in the afterlife - is having a spectacular birthday party, but forgot to invite you! 
However you know that if you can get in he won't stop you. 
However to make sure only invited guests are allowed you were all given a pair of passwords to input into the afterlifely automatic authorization apparatus, but you don't even have one! 
If you can glitch out the apparatus, however...


(Would a ghost celebrate their birthday when they were born, or when they died? After all, it was a new birth into the afterlife...)"
