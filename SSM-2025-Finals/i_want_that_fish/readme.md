  "you say, pointing towards the shelf in front of you.

  The man in front of you smiles and turns around,
  but as his eyes trace where you were pointing his expression changes.


  \"Ah yes, you may have this fish,\" he replies, taking the fish next to the one you pointed at.


  \"I want that fish.\" you respond, still pointing at the fish.


  \"Oh sorry, this fish?\" the man grabs another fish next to the you pointed at.


  \"I want _that_ fish!\" you point aggressively.


  \"I'm not giving you that fish. Pick another.\" the man continues, starting to get somewhat annoyed.


  \"But I _need_ the flagfish!\" you almost yell at the man.


  \"You may _not_ have that fish, understand!?\" 
  the man also raises his voice, seemingly taken aback by the fact that you know the name of the fish.


  \"I _need that_ fish!\" you continue.


  You and the man stare at each other for several seconds, not breaking eye contact.


  Eventually the man yields.


  \"You know what? I'll give you the flagfish on one condition.\" the man begins.
  

  You look at him expectantly.


  \"The apple merchant over there has a magical transmutation apparatus. 
  I will put the fish into the apparatus, and if you can reverse the magic it will be yours, free of charge.
  It's a fair deal.\"
  

  You nod vigorously. All for the fish!


  Left unspoken — and not on your mind, full as it is of the flagfish — is the fact that the man will keep watch, 
  and finding out how to reverse the apple merchant's transmutations might just be worth the price of a flagfish.


  The man sighs.
  You watch him — carefully scrutinizing his every move — as he picks up the flagfish 
  and walks over to the transmutation apparatus.


  Suddenly you start to feel a headache brewing as you witness the man put the fish into the endlessly complicated apparatus..."
